# ItTakesTwoFree
It Takes Two is a co-op action-adventure game where two players control a couple turned into dolls, navigating imaginative worlds to fix their fractured relationship. Combining puzzle-solving, platforming, and teamwork, it offers a unique story-driven experience that can only be played in split-screen co-op â€” locally or online.
